I am a theoretical evolutionary biologist, which means I use mathematical models and computer simulations to investigate the interplay of evolutionary and ecological processes.
My current research focuses on the evolution of social behaviors such as cooperation and conflict. 
Past research topics have included sex allocation and biological diversification. 
I use a theoretical approach (with an emphasis on adaptive dynamics and individual‑based simulations), occasionally in combination with empirical work.
To learn more about my work, take at look at my [publications](./publications.html), watch my Ph.D. [exit seminar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nkYLuEFouVqVUXvg4NqzLxNpD3SVc0La/view?usp=sharing), or [get in touch](./contact.html).

I've recently defended my Ph.D. at the [Biodiversity Research Centre](https://biodiversity.ubc.ca/), in the [University of British Columbia](www.ubc.ca), in Vancouver BC, Canada, under the supervision of [Dr Michael Doebeli](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~doebeli/webpage/). 
I graduated *summa cum laude* from the Erasmus Mundus Master Programme in Evolutionary Biology ([MEME](https://www.evobio.eu/)), obtaining a double degree from the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) in the Netherlands (supervised by [Dr Ido Pen](https://www.rug.nl/staff/i.r.pen/)) and [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en/) in Sweden (jointly supervised by [Dr Claus Rueffler](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N13-2069) and [Dr Simone Immler](https://simoneimmler.com/)). 
I got my undergraduate degree in Biology from the [University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/en), in my home country of Portugal.

I currently live and work in Uppsala, Sweden.
